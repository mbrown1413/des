* Make des.c and des_64.c take input on the command line.  Then update
  documentation in README.rst
* Consolidate tables and functions used in multiple C files.
* Make des_64.c do permutation elimination like crack/ does, i.e., do initial
  permutation first, so left and right block can be referenced as 0-31 and
  32-63.
* Make des.c and des_64.c do both encryption and decryption.
* Write crack/README.rst
* Remove some optimizations and clean up des.c; it should be easy to follow,
  not fast.
